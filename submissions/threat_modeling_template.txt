Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

1. Spoofing - Docker connects virtual interfaces created in bridge mode to a common bridge called docker0. 
This default networking model is vulnerable to ARP spoofing and MAC flooding attacks as there is no filtering 
applied to it.

2. Tampering - The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the 
Docker server based on the given server certificate. It must therefore be individually owned and group owned 
by root to prevent modification by less privileged users.

3. Information Disclosure - By default, unrestricted network traffic is enabled between all containers on 
the same host on the default network bridge. Thus, each container has the potential of reading all packets 
across the container network on the same host. This might lead to an unintended and unwanted disclosure of 
information to other containers. Hence, restrict inter-container communication on the default network bridge.

4. Denial of Service - By default a container can use all of the memory on the host. You can use memory 
limit mechanisms to prevent a denial of service occurring where one container consumes all of the hostâ€™s 
resources and other containers on the same host are therefore not able to function. Having no limit on memory 
usage can lead to issues where one container can easily make the whole system unstable and as a result unusable.

5. Elevation of Privilege - Due to traffic network spoofing, an attacker can gain access to the host and other containers. 
Unnecessary packages should not be installed in the container.

Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden 
based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be 
different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
